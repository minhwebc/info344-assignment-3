For extra credit, i implemented multi threaded crawler using threadpool, but i dont think it matches the speed
that CK mentioned (100 per min). It only can crawl about 20 per mins. 
I also implement the dashboard so it will update the stats over time, the dashboard will make call to worker role
every 5 seconds to update the stats. 
I also store the HTML body text while removing all the HTML tags. To see this please go to http://crawler1234.cloudapp.net/Admin.asmx
and check out the GetLinksTable function. In there you will see all the link entities that were crawled and added to the cloud table.
This also includes the body text of the link.
